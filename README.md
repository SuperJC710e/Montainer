## Problem Statement
Updating a Minecraft server can be tedious and error-prone. While players can easily update their game via Microsoft Store or other platforms, server admins have to manually download and replace files, risking inconsistencies and errors. Montainer simplifies this process.

## Solution
Montainer (Minecraft + Container) provides a self-contained Minecraft Bedrock server in a Docker container, streamlining updates through automated web scraping of Mojang's website. By using the `:latest` tag, users can always deploy the most recent server version with minimal effort.

## Features
1. **Docker Container**: The Minecraft server is encapsulated in a Docker container, making it easy to deploy and manage.
2. **Web UI Console**: Montainer comes with a web UI console, providing a user-friendly interface for managing your server.
3. **Automatic Updates**: The repository is updated automatically by web scraping the Mojang website. This means you can always use the `:latest` tag to get the most recent version of the server. You can also use auto-deploying programs like [watchtower](https://github.com/containrrr/watchtower) to ensure your server is always up-to-date.
4. **Volume Mounting**: Montainer allows you to store world data and configuration files on the host, enabling easy backup, restore, and migration.
5. **Subpath Support**: Set unique subpaths for multiple servers on a single host, so you can manage them independently within the same Docker environment.

## TODO
- [x] Add a Backup button in the web UI console to back up server data to AWS S3.
- [ ] Implement Command autofill in the web UI console.
- [ ] Add Log export functionality to integrate with log aggregation services.

# Montainer Deployment Guide

## Docker Deployment (Recommended)

### Platform-Specific Instructions

#### For Native AMD64 and Apple Silicon
```yaml
services:
  montainer:
    image: ghcr.io/wasinuddy/montainer-stable:latest  # Use 'montainer-preview' for Snapshot server
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"       # Web UI console
      - "19132:19132/udp" # Minecraft Bedrock server
    volumes:
      - ./worlds:/app/instance/worlds  # World data
      - ./configs:/app/configs         # Server configurations
    restart: unless-stopped
```

#### For ARM64 Machines  (tested on Ampere Altra A1)
> **Note**: The official Mojang binary does not support ARM64 architecture. However, you can run the Docker image on ARM64 machines using Linux Kernel **binfmt** for architecture emulation. which may lead to performance issues.

```yaml
services:
  binfmt:
    image: tonistiigi/binfmt
    privileged: true
    command: --install all
    restart: "no"
  
  montainer:
    image: ghcr.io/wasinuddy/montainer-stable:latest  # Use 'montainer-preview' for Snapshot server
    platform: linux/amd64  # Explicitly specify platform
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"       # Web UI console
      - "19132:19132/udp" # Minecraft Bedrock server
    volumes:
      - ./worlds:/app/instance/worlds  # World data
      - ./configs:/app/configs         # Server configurations
    restart: unless-stopped
    depends_on:
      binfmt:
        condition: service_completed_successfully
```



## Accessing the Server

1. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`
2. Use the Web UI console to start/stop the server and manage settings

## Kubernetes Deployment ðŸš¢

Montainer supports Kubernetes deployment with the following requirements:
- Your Ingress Controller must support WebSocket connections
- Both HTTP and WebSocket protocols are used for the web UI console

> For detailed Kubernetes deployment instructions, please refer to our Kubernetes documentation.
