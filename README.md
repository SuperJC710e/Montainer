## Problem Statement
Updating a Minecraft server can be tedious and error-prone. While players can easily update their game via Microsoft Store or other platforms, server admins have to manually download and replace files, risking inconsistencies and errors. Montainer simplifies this process.

## Solution
Montainer (Minecraft + Container) provides a self-contained Minecraft Bedrock server in a Docker container, streamlining updates through automated web scraping of Mojang's website. By using the `:latest` tag, users can always deploy the most recent server version with minimal effort.

## Features
1. **Docker Container**: The Minecraft server is encapsulated in a Docker container, making it easy to deploy and manage.
2. **Web UI Console**: Montainer comes with a web UI console, providing a user-friendly interface for managing your server.
3. **Automatic Updates**: The repository is updated automatically by web scraping the Mojang website. This means you can always use the `:latest` tag to get the most recent version of the server. You can also use auto-deploying programs like [watchtower](https://github.com/containrrr/watchtower) to ensure your server is always up-to-date.
4. **Volume Mounting**: Montainer allows you to store world data and configuration files on the host, enabling easy backup, restore, and migration.
5. **Subpath Support**: Set unique subpaths for multiple servers on a single host, so you can manage them independently within the same Docker environment.

## TODO
- [ ] Add a Backup button in the web UI console to back up server data to AWS S3.
- [ ] Implement Command autofill in the web UI console.
- [ ] Add Log export functionality to integrate with log aggregation services.

## Usage

1. **Deploy Montainer with Docker (recommended):**

   ```yaml
   services:
     montainer:
       image: ghcr.io/wasinuddy/montainer-stable:latest # 'montainer-preview' for Snapshot server
       ports:
         - "8000:8000"      # Web UI console on port 8000
         - "19132:19132/udp" # Minecraft Bedrock server port
       volumes:
         - ./worlds:/app/instance/worlds # Mount for world data
         - ./configs:/app/configs       # Mount for server configurations
       restart: unless-stopped
   ```

2. **Access the web UI console**:
   Visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser. Use the Start/Stop button to control the server directly from the console.

3. **Kubernetes Deployment** ðŸš¢
   Montainer can also be deployed on Kubernetes. Ensure your Ingress Controller supports WebSocket, as both HTTP and WebSocket are used for the web UI console.
